# RETC

RETC is a custom dll shim and a server application designed to be the middleman between the Razer Chroma SDK and the Corsair CUE SDK.

# Usage:

- Copy `RzChromaSDK[64].dll` into either `C:\Windows\System32` or the game client directory.
- Download the corsair cue sdk from the [official corsair download page](http://downloads.corsair.com/download?item=Files/Gaming-Keyboards/CUESDK_2.4.67.zip) 
- Put the `CUESDK[.x64]_2015.dll` files from the extracted archive folder `CUESDK\bin\[i386,amd64]` into the same folder as retc-rpc-server[-64].exe
- Before you start any games run `retc-rpc-server[-64].exe` and leave the console window open.

Read the `retc-server.log` it should help you with your problems.
The simple turning it off and on again approach will also work wonders most of the time if something fails.
